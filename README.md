# Bib-Latex-Remove-Duplicate-Authors
Remove duplicate authors in LaTex files for authors. This works by scanning your references.bib file, then exporting the author names from the cleaned .bib file.

I've attached a reference.bib file for an example. Run the script, and a new reference_cleaned.bib file will appear.
