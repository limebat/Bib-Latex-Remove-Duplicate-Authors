# Bib-Latex-Remove-Duplicate-Authors
Remove duplicate authors in LaTex files for authors. This works by scanning your references.bib file, then exporting the author names from the cleaned .bib file.

I've attached a references.bib file for an example. Run the script, and a new references_cleaned.bib file will appear. Feel free to share or use in another repo, just don't forget to put me in the cited docs!
